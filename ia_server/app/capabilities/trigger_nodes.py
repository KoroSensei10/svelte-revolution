Sends the player contribution + remaining (un-fired) trigger rules to Mistral

Decide whether the player's contribution matches one of the configured trigger rules.

Respond ONLY with a JSON object of this exact shape, no extra text:
{"matched_rule_index": <integer or null>, "reason": "<short explanation>"}

Rules are 0-indexed. If no rule clearly matches, return null.

IMPORTANT: The "reason" field must always be specific and reference concrete details
from the player's contribution. Never give generic reasons like "no match" or
"no clear match to configured trigger rules". Instead, briefly describe WHAT the
player actually said or did, then explain WHY it does or does not satisfy a rule.
Example: "The player discusses trade routes but does not explicitly agree to join
the Syndicate's shadow operations."."""
